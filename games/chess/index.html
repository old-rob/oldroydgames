    <p>Possible moves are highlighted when you select a piece.</p>
    <p>Here is an explanation of the pieces that deviate from standard chess:</p>
    <p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM0NTg3NjkucG5n/original/0MtN3g.png" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>This piece is called a Pike. It can move forward, back, left, or right 1 square. It can capture diagonally in any direction. It is basically an upgraded pawn, and is very useful for shoring up weakened pawn structures. It can also promote to
      any
      major piece when it reaches the back rank, but it can't move forward two spaces on its first move, so it has a long way to go to get there.</p>
    <p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM0NTg3ODkucG5n/original/QG0GmH.png" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>This is a Knighted Bishop. It can move like a bishop or like a knight.</p>
    <p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM0NTg3OTMucG5n/original/tjunuS.png" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>This is a Knighted Rook. It can move like a rook or a knight.</p>
    <figure><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM0NTg3OTgucG5n/original/fBMS5U.png" style="color: inherit; font-size: inherit" loading="lazy"></figure>
    <p>This is a Paladin. It can move like a knight (1 space in one direction, 2 spaces in another direction), or it can move in an expanded knight pattern. 1 space in one direction, 3 spaces in another direction. It can also move 2 spaces in one
      direction, and 2 spaces in another direction. All of its moves are "hops" so it can jump over other pieces.</p>
    <figure><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM0NTg4MDgucG5n/original/eOS5Qk.png" loading="lazy"></figure>
    <p>This piece is an Assassin. It can move to any open square on the board, but it can only capture like a king (one space in any direction).</p>
    <p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM0NTg4MTMucG5n/original/Yr%2Blaj.png" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>This piece is a Wizard. It can switch places with any of your pieces. There are two restrictions. (1) it cannot switch places with a pawn or a pike if it is on the last rank (no instant promotions), and (2) it cannot switch places with your
      king
      if your king is in check.</p>
    <p>I will continue to work on the programming for this browser version of the game to make it look nicer, but I wanted to publish the game now that the concepts are hammered out.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I haven't yet been able to produce an AI engine to play against, so this only functions as a local 2-player game so far, but the board flips with every move and the opponents last move is always highlighted, which makes
      local
      2-player much smoother.</p>
    <p>This was a lot of fun to make, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I do!</p>
